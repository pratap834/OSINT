# OSINT
OSINT Challenge for NULL Event

For some reason completely incomprehensible to mankind, you have become sworn enemies of one of the NULLCTF organizers, . In your efforts to defeat him, you have decided to go back to the origins of the one who crawls at night to learn more about him. This is what you know so far:

- He once claimed that he's been going by "Kurt" for over many decades
- There was a website that he adopted and fostered for about 7 years, based and created on Marvel Universe, created by his disciples who are now known as his fans that has become quite large
- He is portrayed by many in different movies and he is also recognized for his dark appearance with his unique ability to reach anywhere within a wink of an eye

Your goal now is to find this website that he claims as "his".
